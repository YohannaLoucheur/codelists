                The values from this codelist are used to identify the particular list that an organisation identifier was drawn from. The codelist provides a register of known identifier lists, including national company registers, NGO directories and international and multilateral organisation lists - along with guidance and online resources to help locate the identifiers assigned to a specific organisation.

                As of 17 July 2017 this list is maintained by the org-id.guide project. Data publishers can now search for and locate the relevant list for a particular organisation identifier using the `org-id.guide website &lt;http://org-id.guide/&gt;`__. The full register of identifier sources is also available to download in `XML &lt;http://org-id.guide/download.xml&gt;`__, `JSON &lt;http://org-id.guide/download.json&gt;`__ and `CSV &lt;http://org-id.guide/download.csv&gt;`__ formats.

                IATI periodically replicates the codelist of identifier sources from org-id.guide, to assist those accessing IATI documentation. However, it is advised that the most up-to-date source is the `org-id.guide project &lt;http://org-id.guide/&gt;`__.

                If org-id.guide does not contain an entry for the kind of organisation you need to identify, you can make a request a new list is included in the register following the `guidance &lt;http://docs.org-id.guide/en/latest/contribute/&gt;`__ or by getting in touch with org-id.guide at: contact@org-id.guide.

            The Country codelist is generated from the ISO 3166-1 part of the
            ISO 3166 standard. The standard makes allowance, alongside the
            officially assigned codes, for code elements to be expanded by
            using either reserved codes or user-assigned codes. IATI currently
            defines additional codes in the XA -XZ range.
